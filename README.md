# Work Day Calendar App

For this homework, I decided to go a no HTML approach.

I created a for loop and in the for loop created all my html dynamically.
Save me lots of lines. I needed to understand bootstrap classes, which helped a lot.

Once I created the body context adding the time was easy. Understood better how to set local storage and to get from local storage and how to use that and set those text.

Moment.js was something new, I you tube how to use it, and once I realized it was like jQuery, it was easy from there. Like bootstrap, I needed to know the syntax, like I would need to know the classes in bootstrap in moment.js.

My if else statements help remove class and change class if the time matches the time I added on the time slot.
